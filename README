Few things I like to mentioned about my solution:
- I mentioned installs i get during the modules (if i already pip'ed one for a module i did not re-mentioned it)
- I also added some notes and guidelines (mostly for myself) in the code and in the end of the files
- I didn't write all modules in one file but write them in different files with different output files
(like books,books_og, etc) to make debugging and reading easier
- I kinda enjoyed doing it hope you also enjoy reading it
- Here is a playlist to listen while reading the project:
